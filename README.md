# embedCONTROL components for Microsoft .NET

## Limitations to use

You must not build an application called embedCONTROL, with any of the logos, or any variation of that name that is deployed to an App Store or for public deployment, however you are free to build using any name that you own.

Please leave all test to here entact in any forks.

This repo contains the embedCONTROL components for the .NET framework, including an API and several helpers that can build a UI and handle connectivity.

There are projects to build an app for iOS, Android and Windows UWP.
